Voice clone and TTS ðŸš€

## Instructions to use the API:

**1. Create an account** using the endpoint **/users/signup/**.

**2. Authenticate** using the **Authorize** button. Use the same credentials you used to sign up.

**3. Create a model** using the **/create-model/** endpoint. You will need to upload the base voice you want to clone. Your audio file 
should be longer than 30 seconds and shorter than 3 minutes. Once your model is created, you will receive the model ID in the response. 
Make sure to copy it, as youâ€™ll need it to use the TTS functionality.

**4. Convert text to speech** by using the endpoint **/text-to-speech/**. You will need to provide the text you want to convert and the ID of the model you created.
If you forgot your model ID, you can use the **/list-models/** endpoint to retrieve it.

**5. Credits:** This API is in BETA, so each user will have 4 credits to use. This means every time you use the **/create-model/** or **/text-to-speech/** endpoints, you will consume 1 credit.
Once you run out of credits, you will no longer be able to create models or convert text to speech.
